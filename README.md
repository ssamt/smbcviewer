Django app for viewing https://www.smbc-comics.com without ads(for some reason, Adblock Plus doesn't seem to be able to block them). Download it, run the usual django commands, go to development server. This program was mostly developed for my own use, and I do not intend to host it online.
# Notes
Random button does not work.
# Warning
It downloads data(image and text) to static/data folder. It will *not* be deleted automatically. Just delete the whole data folder to empty it.
